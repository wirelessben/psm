# High-level requirements

These are the in-progress requirements defined by the pre-certification
working group at MITRE.  These are draft only and will change.

These are: Function / feature requirements only (excludes functional
specifications, 'objectives' listed within function / feature
requirements, 1 duplicate & 1 combined requirements)

This set of features was extracted from the SGC-developed gap analysis:

1. Capability to link individuals to their organizations and vice versa.
2. Capability to match on multiple variations of an individual's or organization's name to ensure that the correct entity is verified.
3. Ability to apply a range of screening rules to cross check data elements within the enrollment application.
4. Ability to apply a range of screening rules to cross check data elements against authoritative external sources for consistency.
5. Capability to establish and employ a graded screening methodology that escalates the intensity of screening for providers that are flagged as higher risk (that is, Report Card Methodology).
6. Capability to retain screening and enrollment information and results, and compare against past and future screening results.
7. Capability to create a watch list to ensure that providers that are suspected or known to be fraudulent are flagged at the time of screening.
8. Capability to track re-enrollment attempts to ensure that slight changes to provider information are not considered a new enrollment.
9. Capability to revalidate periodically to ensure that changes in provider profiles are updated on a regular basis.
10. Capability to leverage public Web sites to conduct link analysis through which provider associations could be explored, and alerts posted on similar Web sites could be considered.
11. Capability to achieve real time screening, scoring, and system outputs (queries/reports).
12. Capability to persist data sources scores to determine the most reliable source for each data element.
13. Capability to evaluate data sources for reliability and accuracy.
14. Capability to create a learning system to ensure that observed negative trends factor back into screening rules so as to flag suspicious enrollments early in the screening process, ensuring the ability to detect and reduce/eliminate the incidence of false positives.
15. The new application will remember previous rejected providers and reasons for rejection corresponding form fields
16. Capability to create system outputs to assign reasons/explanations to each code or score used.
17. Capability to build processes to allow for appropriate interpretation and action on screening and scoring results.
18. Capability to ensure that each rule is tested and its impact is evaluated prior to implementing.
19. Allows search capability to find specific provider information with minimal search attempts
20. Capability to identify applicants including individual providers and owners of institutional providers
21. Capability to verify identity and prior history of problems with Medicaid/CHIP or Medicare programs
22. Identifies and schedules revalidation process
23. Adheres to the Architectural Guidance and meets the seven conditions and standards detailed in the Guidance for Exchange and Medicaid IT Systems, Version 2.0, located at: http://cciio.cms.gov/resources/files/exchange_medicaid_it_guidance_05312011.pdf.  Information regarding MITA can be found at: http://www.cms.gov/MedicaidInfoTechArch/.
25. Defines a common workflow for collecting enrollment information of individual providers

This set of features was extracted from the MITA/MECT requirements for Provider Management:

26. The system supports communications to and from providers and tracks and monitors responses to the communications.
27. The system supports a provider appeals process in compliance with federal guidelines (42 CFR 431.105)
28. The system uses consistent provider naming conventions to differentiate between first names, last names, and business or corporate names and to allow flexible searches based on the provider name.
29. The system flags and routes records for action if multiple internal state assigned provider numbers are associated with a single provider.
30. The system maintains date-specific provider enrollment and demographic data.
31. The system generates information requests, correspondence, or notifications based on the status of the application for enrollment.
32. SMA tracks and supports the screening of applications (and ongoing provider updates) for (National Provider Identifier (NPIs), State licenses, Specialty Board certification as appropriate, review team visits when necessary, and any other State and/or Federal Requirement.
33. The system verifies provider eligibility in support of other system processes, i.e. payment of claims.
34. The system cross-references license and sanction information with other state or federal agencies.
35. The system maintains the capability to limit billing and providers to certain benefit plans, services, by procedure codes, ranges of procedure codes, member age or by provider type(s) or as otherwise directed by the State.
36. The system supports automated criminal background checks for all providers as specified by the State.
37. The State plan must provide for the identification of providers by Employer identification number unless the provider is in solo practice or the provider is not in solo practice but billing is by the individual practitioner in which case the identification is by social security number.
38. The system maintains a flag for providers who are eligible to use electronic funds transfer (eft) and electronic claims submission.
39. The system accepts, validates, and processes transactions or user entries to update and maintain provider information.
40. The system maintains an audit trail of all updates to the provider data, for a time period specified by the state.
41. The system maintains providersâ€™ drug enforcement administration (DEA) numbers.
