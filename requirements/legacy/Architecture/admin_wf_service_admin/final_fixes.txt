Final Fixes

As per forums, the fixes to the backed services will be provided in the change document in the other agent fixes a bit later

This will inlcude all ERD and hibernate mapping file changes for the new entities.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Section: 1.1.1 Each functional requirement from the Application Requirements Specification and Competition Specification is addressed.

Issue: 
faeton
1. The requirements are not completely met. Crucial details are missing, like controllers implementation method definition, implementation is missing at all.
2. Notifications
3.  Manage provider type:
- We need separate method in controller to load provider type list and details.
- need separate method for showing business rules.
- need method for getting lookup values of provider agreement, provider agreement addendum.
4. We need separate method for displaying help based on a start letter.
5. In controllers where table data is present, we also need to pass to them pages number and page size.
6.  I don't see how authentication/authentication is reused. I see it's not in scope, but it should be integrated still. No score down.
7.  I am not sure whether we can handle every validation only using annotation based things. So to say, we also need to handle whether update is done for object, which is not existing in db or the fields updated are actually from changed request, e.g. the value for drop down was sent to server and there's actually no value for this entity

AleaActaEst
1.  Only two controllers are fully described in the documentation bit for an assembly level competition all should be described in detail.


Response:
faeton
1. Provided now
2. The event service now provided for this
3. The provider type ist loaded. As per forum clarifications, rules are not done in the controller, and the agrteements now added
4. Added extra method to search help, which proivides this
5. Successfully appealed
6. This security is indeed not in scope
7. Validators added to do lookup validation, where applicable. IN fact only the ProviderType has such a looku value check, so only one validator added.

AleaActaEst
1. All controllers defined

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Section: 1.1.2 Each functional requirement is represented in at least one Sequence Diagram. 

Issue:  SD is missing in service layer which shows interactions with dao and persistence. I would suggest to show search method which is the most complicated here.
We don't perform here audit directly, it is irrelevant and can be removed. No scoredown.

Response: I have added the agreement document service's search method SD
Since the audit still takes place, the SD is relevant


-------------------------------------------------------------------

Section: 1.1.3 Required business processes are clearly accounted for in the design.

All issues covered as per 1.1.1

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Section: 2.3.1 The Data Model is appropriate and correctly normalized for the project requirements

Issue: 
1. AgreementDocument should be renamed to AgreementAddendum.
2. AgreementAddendum should have a field telling whether it is Agreement or Addendum.
3. ERD for the AgreementAddendum should be provided.
4. Persistence mapping file for the AgreementAddendum should be provided.

Response:
1. I believe the name is fine, since an addeddum is just a type of agreement document.
2. Done
3,4: This will be provided as part of the service update document that will be provided as part of the agent fixes as per forums

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Section: 2.4.2 Are architecture defined interfaces appropriate and optimal?

Issue: BaseServiceAdminController.providerProfileService should be removed,
it should be defined in concrete controller(s).

Response: Done


-------------------------------------------------------------------

Section: 3.1.1 All required documents are provided and are of sufficient content

Issue: 
1. 1.3.16  Mapping files is irrelevant
2.  Formatting issues in contents. No cascade, but please fix it.
3. he impl. notes are missing a lot. See 1.1.1
4. ADS 2 "User Interface" section should discuss used technologies and approaches for the front end pages.
5. Other issues as per 1.1.1

Response:
1. I rephrased it to be relevant
2. The formatting as seen is as intended
3. Fixed
4. Added
5. As per 1.1.1


-------------------------------------------------------------------

Section: 3.2.2 Class diagrams are complete and include sufficient detail

Issue: 
1. It's unclear which service, Local or Remote should Bean extend, though it is understandable from ADS.
2. Other issues as per 1.1.1

Response:
1. Added note in that diagram to clarify this
2. As per 1.1.1
