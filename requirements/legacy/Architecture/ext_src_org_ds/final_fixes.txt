Final Fixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Section: 1.1.1 Each functional requirement from the Application Requirements Specification and Competition Specification is addressed.

Issue: 
faeton 
1. You should provide concrete field mapping of your result document to the ProviderProfile or License entities. Currently, it's unknown what should be mapped where.
2. For some data, like PharmacyLicensingSearchDAOBean, you create a License list, but have SearchResult<ProviderProfile> as result. 
3. I don't see where this site is covered:
http://mhcpproviderdirectory.dhs.state.mn.us 
4. Better somewhere provide mapping what service maps to which site, this way it's easier to navigate. No scoredown for this, but leave as required. 
5. http://licensinglookup.dhs.state.mn.us/, if you select Children's Residential Facilities, there's additional fields, which can be selected as criteria.
That's necessary to be incorporated to ChildrensResidentialServiceSearchDAO. 
6.  For http://licensinglookup.dhs.state.mn.us
Open the search page:
http://licensinglookup.dhs.state.mn.us/Results.aspx?crfall=True&z=&crfcc=False&sn=All&s=All&t=All&crfcdc=False&l=&n=&crfsc=False&crfmhlock=False&crfrt=False&tn=All&e=0&ci=Afton&crfd=False&crfmhc=False&crfss=False&con=All&crfgrs=False&co=All&crfts=False
You fetch only the data on this page.
However, you may click on link "Afton Preschool"(http://licensinglookup.dhs.state.mn.us/Details.aspx?l=800047) and then get much more info about license, which also should be parsed.

1. Since this is direct to assembly the DAO methods should be documented clearly. 

Response:

1. DOne explicitly in ADS 1.3.3
2. Fixed so now we all document returning SearchResult<ProviderProfile> 
3. Used in PharmacyLicensingSearchDAOBean as per forum
4. This is provided in introduction in ADS
5. Asked in the forum (http://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Thread&threadID=767560). Not sure it is necessary.
6. Asked in the forum (http://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Thread&threadID=767560). Very sure it is not necessary.

AleaActaEst 
1. Each DAO has complete info. Some of the info references additional info in ADS sections


-------------------------------------------------------------------

Section: 1.1.3 Required business processes are clearly accounted for in the design.

Issue:  Nothing is stated about auditing.

Response: No auditing required for searches. Stated in ADS 1.3.16


-------------------------------------------------------------------

Section: 1.1.4 Design provides a complete technical solution for the customer.

Issue: Since this is direct to assembly the DAO methods should be documented clearly.

Response: Done as per 1.1.1 fix doc above


-------------------------------------------------------------------

Section: 1.3.3 Exception handling is appropriately addressed with regard to the specific needs of this application

Issue: Exception handling: PersistenceException can be thrown at dao layer.

Response: You mean ParsingException. I have added it, as per current code, to the service and DAO impl class.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Section: 2.3.1 The Data Model is appropriate and correctly normalized for the project requirements

Issue: 
1.  SearchCriteria should be as specific as possible, e.g. providing real field and value for it in each of the subclass.
What you do is not flexible.
a) Following your design in the implementation there will be bunch of "if-else" clauses for checking fields
b) Following your design it's not clear what data is search based on at compile time, only at runtime, which hardens to understand the code.
The criteria is well-known.
You do this for LicensedProviderSearchCriteria, though.


2. See in 1.1.1, you may need add some entity for

http://licensinglookup.dhs.state.mn.us/, if you select Children's Residential Facilities, there's additional fields, which can be selected as criteria.
That's necessary to be incorporated to ChildrensResidentialServiceSearchDAO.

Response:
1. In this case, I'm following current approach that you find with MedicaidCertifiedProviderSearchCriteria
2. Issue pending as per 1.1.1 above

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Section: 2.4.2 Are architecture defined interfaces appropriate and optimal?

Issue: For all the DAO beans, which operate on the same site, like "http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/fpc/directory/providerselect.cfm" you could
a) create a single implementation and then simply inject necessary provider type
b) create base class for that.
Currently, there's too many code dublicate, which is unnecessary.

Response: I believe that is something the assembler may do to make code simple. No need to intervene here myself.


-------------------------------------------------------------------

Section: 3.1.1 All required documents are provided and are of sufficient content

Issue: 
1. I don't see that sorting here is relevant.
2. Since this is direct to assembly the DAO methods should be documented clearly.

Response:
1. ADS section removed
2. Done as per 1.1.1 fix doc above


-------------------------------------------------------------------

Section: 3.2.2 Class diagrams are complete and include sufficient detail

Issue: 
1. I don't see where are BaseService, BaseDao are defined. Were they implemented in previous archs?
2. Main Use Case Diagram is irrelevant, that's not design :) Why did you add that? No scoredown. Is it MITA compatibility I'm missing?

Response:
1. The come from the service module, as per ADS 1.2.4
2. Yes, this is a MITA thing. WHen I did previous such architectures, this was required.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Section: 3.3.3 Are competition specifications scoped properly?

Issue: You didn't specify which search criterias goes to which assembly, though this is somehow clear from the context

Response: I dont explicitly list them, but each assembly states that the entities involved with those services are in scope.
