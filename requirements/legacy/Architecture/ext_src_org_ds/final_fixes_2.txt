5. http://licensinglookup.dhs.state.mn.us/, if you select Children's Residential Facilities, there's additional fields, which can be selected as criteria.
That's necessary to be incorporated to ChildrensResidentialServiceSearchDAO. 
6.  For http://licensinglookup.dhs.state.mn.us
Open the search page:
http://licensinglookup.dhs.state.mn.us/Results.aspx?crfall=True&z=&crfcc=False&sn=All&s=All&t=All&crfcdc=False&l=&n=&crfsc=False&crfmhlock=False&crfrt=False&tn=All&e=0&ci=Afton&crfd=False&crfmhc=False&crfss=False&con=All&crfgrs=False&co=All&crfts=False
You fetch only the data on this page.
However, you may click on link "Afton Preschool"(http://licensinglookup.dhs.state.mn.us/Details.aspx?l=800047) and then get much more info about license, which also should be parsed.
