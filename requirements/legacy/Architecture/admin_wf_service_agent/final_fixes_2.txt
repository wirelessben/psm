Final Fixes 2

I have submitted the change request with this submission, and will followup with the ERD and hibernate: http://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Thread&threadID=764914

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Issue:
1. In ARS 2.5 there is a filtering functionality which would filter the fetched data from the search. It uses the "NPI/UMPI" but I do not see how this is handled in the submission. 
2. The ARS talks about printing the enrollment data in a printer friendly fashion. I see no information about this requirement. 

Response:
1. I have aktered the sigranture of the profile service's search criteria object to also work with npi (see change document)
2. Current approach confirmed: http://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Thread&threadID=764927
