Notes on some issues that may warrant creating new reqs that fit them better.

1. Issues related to fostering the user community (as opposed to the 
developer/contributor community), and other outward facing promotional stuff:

  394 - Systematize and advertise online PSM community of practice
  395 - Create standalone PSM brochure website
  439 - Auto-update standalone user docs website and PDF
  458 - bundle user & developer docs for psm-dev

2. Issues relating to code quality in terms of separation of concerns, 
modularity, avoiding unnecessary coupling.

  599 - Stop checking for access permissions for system-internal lookups
  653 - Remove styles from labels

3. Issues on being state-agnostic/generic, not hard-coding one state.

  655 - Remove or generify UMPI field

Karl thought 599, 653, and 655 were covered by SQ-1.5.  Paul when first
making these notes was taking a narrower interpretation of D.R.Y. principles.
Left in the notes here for follow-up as needed.
