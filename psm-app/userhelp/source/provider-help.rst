Provider help documentation
===========================

This is documentation for health care providers using the Provider
Screening Module.

Do I count as a provider?
-------------------------

Providers are:

-  people and organizations that render health care services
-  group practices that furnish health care supplies to patients
-  in some cases, other people or organizations who are eligible to be
   reimbursed through Medicaid for providing certain services

Providers can be sole proprietorships or incorporated practices.

How do I change my name in this system? Can I update it in one place for all my `applications <application.html>`__?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If an `application <application.html>`__ is a draft (you haven't submitted
it yet), then yes, you can click on the draft application and edit your
name. If you have already submitted the application, then it is not
possible to edit your name as associated with that application; you'll
need to contact the state/territory Medicaid office directly.

Currently it is not possible for you to change your name for your
account; you will need to contact a system administrator at your state
Medicaid office to do this.

`A future version of the PSM will allow you to change your name in the
system. <https://github.com/EMRTS/psm/issues/408>`__

How do I update my contact information for an approved application? Can I update it in one place for all my applications?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once an application has been approved, you cannot change the contact
information in it via this system (although `a future version of the PSM
will allow you to do
this <https://github.com/EMRTS/psm/issues/416>`__); please
contact the state/territory Medicaid office directly.

How do I update my license/certification information for an approved application (e.g., if I have renewed my license)?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once an application has been approved, you cannot change the license and
certification information in it via this system (although `a future
version of the PSM will allow you to do
this <https://github.com/EMRTS/psm/issues/416>`__); please
contact the state/territory Medicaid office directly.
