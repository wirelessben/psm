Why do we have this application process?
========================================

Under Medicaid and similar programs, federal and state/territory governments
pay doctors, pharmacists, and other medical service providers for treating
patients. State/territory and federal regulations require providers to meet
eligibility standards. The application process is where we verify that
eligibility. The Provider Screening Module (PSM) helps states manage the
application process so that eligible providers can serve Medicaid
clients.

The goal of the PSM is to make it as easy as possible for providers to
enroll (encouraging enrollment and thus improving service to Medicaid
patients), and as easy as possible for administrators to manage
applications.
