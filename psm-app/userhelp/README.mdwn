# User help documentation for the PSM

We use Gradle and Sphinx to build reStructuredText files into
user-readable help documents in HTML, PDF, and ePub formats. The
source documents live in `source/`. [Read The Docs's guide to
Sphinx](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) is
a good guide to our usage of Sphinx.

We also publish HTML, PDF, and ePub versions of the PSM documentation
to [a GitHub Pages site](https://EMRTS.github.io/psm/) that
is updated every few weeks (see [the GitHub
issue](https://github.com/EMRTS/psm/issues/452)).

## HTML generation

To build the documentation as HTML:

~~~
$ cd psm-app
$ ./gradlew userhelp:html
~~~

Then you should be able to see
`psm-app/userhelp/build/html/index.html` in your browser.

## PDF generation

To build the documentation as a single PDF file, you'll need to
install some LaTeX packages locally.

~~~
$ sudo apt install \
    texlive-latex-recommended \
    texlive-fonts-recommended \
    texlive-latex-extra \
    latexmk
$ cd psm-app
$ ./gradlew userhelp:pdf
~~~

Sphinx will create `userhelp/build/latex/ProviderScreeningModuleusermanual.pdf`.

Each time the underlying content changes, or the styling choices (as
defined in `conf.py`) change, you'll have to rerun the `userhelp:pdf`
task to generate an updated PDF.

## ePub generation

To build the documentation as a single ePub ebook file:

~~~
$ cd psm-app
$ ./gradlew userhelp:epub
~~~

Sphinx will create `userhelp/build/epub/ProviderScreeningModuleusermanual.epub`.
