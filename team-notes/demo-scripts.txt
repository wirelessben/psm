   Scripts for live demonstrations of the PSM to various audiences.
   ================================================================

If you use Emacs org mode, this file will be easier to read.

* Update to demo site in June 2018
The audience for this section is mostly @jvasile, or others who are
familiar with how the PSM has developed over time.

The provider side looks similar to previous versions, most
differences are on the admin side, and we should show more information.

* For MESC 2018
  (`master` branch as of 10 August 2018)

  Use demo.psm.solutionguidance.com or a local copy.

  For this demo, you should have a copy of the LEIE API running at
  localhost:5000 (that is, on the same box that is running the PSM on
  port 8080).  The demo copy of the PSM should have the following users
  and applications:
  
  - provider1 (a valid provider)
  - excluded1 (an excluded provider)
  - admin (a reviewer)

  - A draft Durable Medical Equipment (DME) application with a valid NPI
    (user: provider1) and multiple owners
  - A draft Audiologist application with excluded NPI (user: excluded1)

  This demo assumes that much of the provider information has already
  been filled in -- that is, that we're re-opening an application in
  progress and continuing it.  This is to save time during the demo.  To
  insert this information, run:

  $ psql -h localhost -U psm -d psm
  psm=> DROP OWNED BY ${psm_user};
  $ \i team-notes/demo-db-201808-master.sql

  $ cd {path-to-psm}/psm-app
  $ ./gradlew db:update

  If you use the pre-filled data, make sure the provider statement date
  is today's date.

  # add a fake exclusion to LEIE data, to avoid demo-ing with a real
  person's name.  Do this after running `etl.py` and before running
  `serve.py`.

  $ cd {path-to-cavetl}/leie/leie
  
  $ sqlite3 leie.sqlite3 <<EOF
INSERT INTO exclusion(
  firstname,
  lastname,
  general,
  npi,
  dob,
  address,
  city,
  state,
  zip,
  excltype,
  excldate
) values (
  'Demo',
  'Exclusion',
  'NURSING PROFESSION',
  '1234567893',
  '1970-01-01',
  '1234 Main Street',
  'Somewhere',
  'NY',
  '12345',
  '1128b4',
  '2000-01-01'
);
EOF

  Before beginning the demo, stop and restart Wildfly to reduce the risk
  of "out of memory" errors.


* DEMO PLAN:

  1. Show an organizational provider application with a valid provider:
  
     - Log in as provider1
     - Durable Medical Equipment (DME) application already exists
       - Click "Edit" under "Actions" column
       - "Previous page" goes one back
       - Point out multiple owners without going back further or
         entering data, to save time. (And possibly avoid a bug that
         may or may not still exist. In August 2018, Paul was able
         to navigate all the way to the beginning without entering
         or changing any inputs, without hitting any issues.)
       - Given time and interest, click the "?" next to "Type" for an
         owner to show the user help modal pop-up.
     - Click "Next", then submit the application
  
     - Back at the applications table, note that DME is automatically
       flagged as "High" risk (based on DME provider type)
  
  2. Show an individual provider application with multiple locations:
     - Log in as excluded1
     - "Audiologist" application exists
     - Click "Edit" and then "Previous" all the way back to the beginning,
       to show the screens
     - Has an excluded NPI: 1234567893 (this is a fake one that doesn't
       show a real provider's name) 
     - License info
       - Indian reservation question is MN-specific, but we can ask
         similar questions for other states
       - Upload the fake license:
         docs/sample-generic-provider-license.pdf (should
         already be there)
     - Validation tests, if there's time: on the license info page, enter
       a Renewal End Date that's earlier than Original Issue Date and
       click next to show the error (there's no error immediately on
       tabbing away from the field).
    - Practice Info:
       - For "Are you employed and/or independently contracted by a group
         practice?" choose Yes
         - At bottom of page, click "Add Another Practice Location"
           - Group NPI can be the same as the initial Provider NPI, and we
             can use the same NPI for multiple locations

      - Submit the application

      - Back on the dashboard, note that Audiologists are "Limited" risk
        (the lowest level).  This is true even though we happen
        to know that the NPI we used is one that is excluded -- risk
        levels right now are *only* based on provider type.

  3. Admin review flow:
     - Login as "admin"
     - Navigate to "ENROLLMENTS" tab, then "Pending" subtab (or just use
       the "All" tab and look for "pending" in the Status column).
     - Look at available "Actions"
     - Export downloads it as a PDF. Edit, Print, and Add Note are what it
       says on the tin (but the Notes UI is up for revision).
     - Review is what we're interested in.
     - Click "Review" on the Audiologist application
       - Only current external sources appear (LEIE), mention others coming
       - Note particularly "Applicant Must Not Be In the Excluded
         Providers List." in the list of errors
       - We can click on the "FAIL" (other values are "PASS," and "ERROR")
         in the Auto Screening column to see full results in new browser tab
       - Click "FAIL" to view results for "EXCLUDED PROVIDER VERIFICATION
         IN OIG (checked means not in exclusion list)."
         - Results show up in a new tab
         - "This provider appears in the LEIE and should be rejected."
         - Results below show more details, and the matching LEIE records.
       - Go back to original tab
         - If interested, say that we're not doing automated screening
           for other external sources (yet).
         - Can view the license file if there's time/interest
       - Click "Reject" button and the application will show up in the
         "Denied" tab. (And in the "All" tab, but now with "Denied" in
         Status column.) We no longer have the ability to re-review

     - Now, the non-excluded provider version:
       - Go back to the "Pending" tab (or use the "All" tab, looking for
         "Pending" in Status column)
       - Review the DME application
       - Note that "EXCLUDED PROVIDER VERIFICATION IN OIG (checked means
         not in exclusion list)" is already checked -- this person is
         not in the LEIE!
         - Click "PASS" link and see "This provider does not appear in the
         LEIE and may be approved." With more details below.
       - If there were other screening sources, we'd manually check their
         checkboxes.
       - Later, other sources can be added to this list
       - Click "Approve" button for the DME application, and see "request
         has been sent" message, the provider will be sent a confirmation
         email. The application will show up in the "Approved" tab (and
         the "All" tab as "Approved").
         
  4. Admin Reports tab
     - See the list of initial reports -- note that more can be added,
       and we expect to update and improve these.
     - "Applications by Reviewer"
       - only shows the applications that have been either Approved or
         Denied -- doesn't show pending or drafts
     - "Draft Applications"
       - shows number of drafts over time. If a table row has a submitted
         date then the application is no longer a draft, but it was one
         during that month, so it is included in the report.
     - "Time to Review"
       - the most-requested report -- shows how long it takes an
         application to go through the process.  Ideally this would show
         that the state is moving providers from submission to review in
         decreasing or stable amounts of time.
     - "Provider Types"
       - number of applications by provider type, over time
     - "Reviewed Documents"
       - number of documents (licenses) reviewed over time
     - "Risk Levels"
       - number of applications reviewed in each risk level over time

  5. Admin Screenings tab
     *Warning*: Almost all of this page is not yet wired up! It is
     basically read-only. Buttons, links, tabs, any interactivity, etc.
     is not functional, so set that expectation with audiences.
     You can show/hide the filter panel; that's pretty much it.
     - It shows the screening tests we've run on applications so far,
       either as part of the regular submission process or as regular
       re-screening over time. Eventually it will allow filtering to show
       only re-screenings or only initial screenings, etc.

* Notes about the demo, as background:
  - Valid provider:
     - Choose "Durable Medical Equipment"
     - NPI: 1111111112 (valid, non-excluded)
       - Perhaps note that we are searching the LEIE via NPI right now
     - Effective Date must be within past 12 months: 07/01/2017
     - "Ownership Info" (something that a couple states have asked
       about)
       - Business type: corporation
       - Note that you can add multiple individual owners of a corporation
         - The "This person/business has an ownership or control
           interest in another Medicaid disclosing entity, or an entity that
           does not participate in Medicaid but is required to disclose
           ownership and control interest because of participation in any
           Title V, XVIII, or XX programs. " is quite broken -- see #308
         - I'd suggest using it as an example of validation errors, then
           unchecking it to continue
