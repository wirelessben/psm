Met on conf call at 11:30am ET.
Attendees: James, Dan, Karl, Jason, Cecilia

* GitHub repos restructuring, and reflecting structure in README.md   
** DONE File a ticket about separating ext-srcs.                    :CECILIA:
   https://github.com/SolutionGuidance/psm/issues/11
* Any need for an Oracle DB server?
    - Dan points out that the process of getting WebSphere up (in the
      previous phase) was not easy
    - But Oracle is separate from WebSphere
    - Let's turn on and use existing AWS copy for Jason and everyone to
      play with
      - THEN set up an empty Oracle db
      - And finally move to PSQL
    DECISION: Yup; see TODO items below
** DONE Turn on the old WebSphere/Oracle/Windows instance.      :CECILIA:DAN:
** STARTED Give Jason login creds, DB connection strings, etc, to above :CECILIA:DAN:
** STARTED Set up a fresh, empty Oracle DB for Jason to play with. :CECILIA:DAN:
** STARTED Give Jason a Linux-flavored dev box.                 :CECILIA:DAN:
* Want someone else working in parallel on Oracle->PGSQL conversion?
    - James is looking at this.  DAO and migration scripts are things to
      look at here.  Dan thinks the DAOs are abstracted away from SQL
      flavor.
** TODO James is looking at SQL conversion process a bit this week. :JAMES:
* Why separate repository for ext-srcs?
    Dan says: if ext-srcs is really a separate app, then cleaner
    to have it in an independent repository.
    DECISION: Leave it in same repos for now; revisit possibly.
    DECISION: We might do this, but not deciding to yet.
    - Right now they're not really separate projects -- still very
      coupled as far as implementation.  Shouldn't be separate at the
      moment.
    - If they're going to be separate projects (which would involve some
      work), then they should be in separate repositories.  They should
      be deployable separately.
      - Repository: clone the repo and deploy the whole project.
    - Karl: Let's table this for another week.  Seems reasonable to move
      it to another repo once it actually works by itself.

    - James reminds us that this is *not in scope* for this project!
      It's not in our task list.  We don't really want to do it in our
      spare time.

    - Open a ticket in the "optional" milestone
* Using psm-dev group, public repository for meeting notes, etc.
    - Karl will send meeting notes out on psm-dev group
    - TODO: Dan should check in markdown version of meeting notes doc to
      the tree
    DECISION: start using above
** DONE Check about email addresses
** DONE Send source format for tech report to group.                    :DAN:
** DONE Set up meeting notes area, tech progress reports area, etc, in public repos. :CECILIA:KARL:
* Are any changes in JBoss side that are not in WAS side?
    - We don't think so.
** DONE Nope, so let's just delete the jboss tree.                      :DAN:
* What are our progress signs?
    Find examples of Oracle dependencies and WebSphere dependencies.
    E.g.,
    - SQL can load into DB
    - Fix one launch error, get to next one
    - PSM (separate from ext-srcs) deployed
* Timeline
    - Remember that this is aggressive, don't worry if we don't make it
* Next steps for Jason from Dan
    - Oracle dependencies
    - Find WebSphere 
** DONE Ticket this just for tracking                               :CECILIA:
   https://github.com/SolutionGuidance/psm/issues/12
** DONE Karl to post on psm-dev about this                             :KARL:
