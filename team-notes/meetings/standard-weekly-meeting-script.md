# Weekly Team Meeting Format

This is the list of topics the core development discusses on our weekly
call.  Currently these calls take place on Tuesday afternoons, but that
may change.  Generally the leader of the call prepares by looking at the
[Waffle board](https://waffle.io/SolutionGuidance/psm) and checking over
any individual checkins from the previous week.

1. Updates from everyone: What were you working on last week?  What do
   you plan to work on this week?  Any questions for the rest of the
   team?
1. Bring up any known slow downs / blockers.
1. Go over list of open PRs, make sure someone is responsible to review
   each of them and we all know the status of each of them. 
1. Question for the group: anything we need to know from states?  MITRE?
   Other stakeholders?
1. Open floor: anything we need to discuss?


## Retrospectives

We have retrospectives every 6 weeks or so - mid-phase and at the end of
the phase.  At those, the leader usually compiles a list of
accomplishments since the last retrospective, as a way of reminding
everyone about our accomplishments.  After that list, the usual format
is to give everyone a chance to:

1. Discuss things that have gone well.
1. Express appreciation for others / recognize what teammates have done
   well.
1. Raise any concerns / problems with the current process or status of
   the project.  This is our chance to talk about things that aren't
   going as well as they could be and/or to propose new solutions.
