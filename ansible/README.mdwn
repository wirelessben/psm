This is an ansible role that installs a demo version of the PSM, along
with a series of dependencies.  See comments at the top of
`roles/psm/tasks/main.yml` for more information.

There are a number of variables in the localhost.yml file.  You'll
want to set them.  If you need a dev depolyment, you can `sudo chown`
the psm directory to your user after running this.

Install all this with:

    sudo ./run localhost.yml psm

The `sudo` is needed to have permissions to twiddle the Postgres
databse.

TODO: separate out the mailcatcher stuff for folks that don't want to
use the ruby-based mailcatcher.  They might, for example, want to use
a simple python dummy mail server instead.
